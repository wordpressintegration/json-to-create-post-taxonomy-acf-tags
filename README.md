# Read JSON to Create WordPress Posts

### Read JSON in WordPress and create post, taxonomy, ACF Repeater field</h1>

<p>This is an example of a PHP script. I have created a PHP script to read JSON file, create posts, select available taxonomies, upload multiple images, upload featured image and ACF filed as well as ACF Repeater field by JSON on the WordPress Admin Panel.</p>

<p>To download the script, you first need to clone the repository or copy and paste the product.php file and then enter your JSON file URL in the product.php file. Both should be in the same position (folder). You need to paste both files on the root folder where the wp-config.php file exists.</p>


### Clone file on localsystem

```
git clone https://github.com/wordpressintegration/json-to-create-post-taxonomy-acf-tags.git/
```
